The dataset includes 842 images.
Stairs are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 48 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -22 and +22 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
